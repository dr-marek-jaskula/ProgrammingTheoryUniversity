## git fetch
"git fetch" is the command that tells your local git to retrieve the last metadata from the original. Yet it does not do any file transferring.
We use "fetch" to examine if the changes were pushed to the remote repository or if the new  changes have occurred.

## git merge
"git merge" is the command that incorporates changes from the named commits into the current branch.
It is commonly used to join two branches into one.

## git pull
"git pull" == "git fetch" + "git merge". 

Get the metadata and then bringing the changes from the remote repository to the local environment.
