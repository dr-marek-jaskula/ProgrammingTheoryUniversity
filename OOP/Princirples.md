## DRY

Don't Repeat Yourself.

Avoid using the same or similar code twice and avoid doing the same steps on and on again.

Automatize all what u can. Use reusable methods and generics.

## KISS

Keep It Simple, Stupid.

If the solution can be simpler, then do it.

Avoid using patterns if they are not necessary. Otherwise, they become anti-patterns, like Singleton pattern.

## YAGNI

You ain't gonna need it.

Do not write or keep the code for future.
