## Encapsulation

It refers to restricting the direct access to some of an object's components.

Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing direct access to them by clients in a way that could expose hidden implementation details or violate state invariance maintained by the methods.

To obtain encapsulation in C# we use access modifiers.
