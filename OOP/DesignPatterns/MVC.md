## MVC

Model-View-Controller is a popular design pattern used to organized the structure of the application with GUI (Graphical User Interface).
We divide the app into three parts:
1) Model -> where the business logic is present 
2) View -> User Interface
3) Controller -> The part of application that is responsible for getting the requests from the UI, triggering actions to actualize model and refreshing views
