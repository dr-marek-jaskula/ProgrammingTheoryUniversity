## Strategy design pattern

This is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates different algorithms in a different classes and allow us to choose between them, 
based on a common interface. 
Selection of the interface can be done in runtime.

Strategy is for Open-Closed and Dependency Inversion.  
It is also for Single Responsibility Principle.

## Example

Google maps -> choose path for: car, on foot, bike, bus.
