## Design Pattern

Design patterns are architectural solutions for various problems that can occur in a developer work.

Design patterns are not proved to be objectively true. 
They were tested for a long time. Therefore they were recognized as a proper approach.

We distinguish three categories of design patterns:
- Creational patterns (factory, abstract factory, singleton)
- Structural patterns (adapter)
- Behavioral patterns (Strategy, Observer, Mediator)

It is important to use the pattern only if it is really needed. Otherwise, it can become an anti-pattern (it can make our design worse).

Example design patterns:
+ Singleton
+ Factory
+ Strategy
+ Observer
+ Mediator
+ Adapter
