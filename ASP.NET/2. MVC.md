## MVC architecture

MVC is an architecture pattern that divide the project into three parts:
- Model
- View
- Controller

### Model

Contains the business logic and the domain.

### View

Contains the User Interface: HTML, CSS and more. This is the Front-End part of the application.

### Controller

Connects the model and the view. Here the validation is done.

#### How to pass a model object to a view

> return View("ViewName", objectParameter);

#### Strongly Typed Views

Strongly Type Views are views wherein we get the intellisense for the model.
So they are views that understand the model and provide the intellisense aid.

To create a strongly typed view we need to add at the top of the .cshtml file code like:
> @model List<CustomerApp.Models.Customer>

#### ModelViews

Data that our view needs.

Wrapper class wrapped around many models.
