## ASP.NET

ASP.NET stands for "Active Server Pages Network Enabled Technologies"

It is open source technology.

ASP.NET has three frameworks:
- Web Forms, released on 2003
- MVC 5, released on 2009
- MVC Core, released on 2017

This frameworks have been created be Microsoft to develop web applications.

## Web Forms

- **no** cross platform (only Windows)
- poor performance due to view state and page life cycle
- complicated
- not meant for cloud (there were no clued that time)
- small HTML control
- configuration done by "Web.config"
- need external dependency injection handler
- no self hosting
- no static content

## MVC 5

- **no** cross platform (only Windows)
- less efficient than MVC Core
- medium complication level
- partial cloud help
- good HTML control due to Razor view (Razor engine)
- configuration done by "Web.config"
- need external dependency injection handler
- no self hosting
- no static content folder

## ASP.NET MVC Core

- cross platform (Windows, Linux, Mac)
- good performance (.dll's have low size)
- simplified
- ready for clouds
- good HTML control due to Razor view (Razor engine)
- configuration done by "appsettings.json"
- build in mechanism for dependency injection (container)
- self hosting (Kestrel)
- static content in a wwwroot folder
- completely NuGet managed

## Routing

Routing is process of translating the HTTP requests into the controller actions.
