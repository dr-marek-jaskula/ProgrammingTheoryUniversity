## Authentication

Confirming that the subject is what he says he is. So it is confirming the identity of a subject.

Usually, authentication is present when we log into the server, using a login and a password.

## Authorization

Authorization is a process of determining the subject permissions. So it is determining if the subject should be able to reach a certain resource.

In web applications, we usually do this by user roles, claims, requirements, that determines what actions are allowed for a certain user.

Each resource can have a different level of permission level.
