REST stand for "Representational State Transfer". 

This architectural style founded by Roy Fielding in his Ph.D. dissertation:
“Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures” at UC Irvine. 
He developed it in parallel with HTTP 1.1

When the api is created using such pattern we can access images, posts, videos, text content using certain url and request verb:
- POST (update)
- GET (read)
- PUT (create)
- DELETE (delete)

We use REST primarily as a way to communicate between computer systems on the World Wide Web.
