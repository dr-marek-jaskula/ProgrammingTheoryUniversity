## Primary Key

Primary Key uniquely identifies each row.  
Primary Key is a key that represents the order how the real data are structured (it creates a cluster index).  
Primary Key can be only one in one table.  
Primary Key cannot have null value.  

## Foreign Key

## Unique Key

Unique key constraint can be applied for a column of multiple columns (composite key). Data in such column needs to be unique, so
there can not be any duplicate. Unique key allows null value.

We can have many unique keys in one table.

## Composite Key

It is a key that is applied for multiple columns.
