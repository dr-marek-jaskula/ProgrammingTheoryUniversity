## Triggers

Triggers are small pieces of logic that we want to executed when certain even occurs.

We use TRIGGER keyword.

We can use triggers for instance to update the last update column.

## Trigger types

We have two types of triggers:
- After triggers
	- This trigger happens **after** something happens.

- Instead of triggers
	- If something happens, then **instead** of this event the triggers is executed.
