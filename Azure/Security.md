## JIT VM access

Just-in-time VM access is a way to apply rules for connecting to the VM.
We can expose the port of VM for all hosts or for certain IP or IP range.
We can specify the time, during which the port is exposed.

We can do it by using the "Configuration" blade -> Azure Security Center.  
Then, we can check the rules in "Networking" blade.
