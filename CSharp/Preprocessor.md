## Preprocessor

Preprocessor statements are statements that are considered before the actual code is executed. 
They are preceded by "#" symbol.

They can be used to organized the code: "#region" or to disable the part of the code in certain circumstances "#if". 
For instance if this is a debug mode.

They are widely used for example in a templates, to define the code snippets that should be excluded if for instance the checkbox
is unchecked.
