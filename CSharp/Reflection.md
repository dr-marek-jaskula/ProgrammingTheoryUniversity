## Reflection

This a way to get access to metadata of classes and objects.
By using reflection we can get access to objects variables, even private ones.
We can use reflections to change objects properties dynamically.

Nevertheless, reflections usually are slow, so it is important to be aware of its performance issues.

It is widely use to map or serialize objects.
