## S3 - Simple Storage Service

The oldest service in AWS. It is used to store objects (that in S3 terminology are just files).

Objects are stored into buckets. They are categorized with virtual folders.

We can upload files (for instance images) and then share them with others if we use "Object actions" and select 
Share with a presigned URL (and then specified the number of minutes/hours that the file is available)
