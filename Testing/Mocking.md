## Mocking

Mocking is creating a dummy objects, based on a certain interface, with a fixed, designed behavior.

We use mocks to avoid dependencies or to test different cases and not only a happy path.

Popular frameworks for mocking are:
- Moq
- NSubstitute
- FakeItEasy

I prefer to use NSubstitute library.
