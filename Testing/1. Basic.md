## Unit Test

This is a test that validates a single unit of code (small part of code, usually method or a class).

In Unit Testing every external dependencies is mocked.

Unit Tests are very fast and they can be used very often.

Unit tests are the most important. They should be like 70% of all tests.

## Component Test

A bigger parts of code are tested.

## Integration Test

This is a test that validates the reference to dependencies. The test scope is bigger. 

This is the second most important test. They should be like 20% of all tests.

## End-two-end Test

Test the whole application from the user perspective. It tests also the user experience.
