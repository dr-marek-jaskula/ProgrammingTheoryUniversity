## Monolith Architecture

A monolithic application has a single codebase that contains multiple modules. Modules are divided to their
functional or technical characteristic. Single build system and single executive.

They are easy to develop, debug, test and deploy. 

However, they are complex (when it growths), hard to maintain and making the change affect different parts of application.

Monolith can use single technology. Moreover is hard scalable.
