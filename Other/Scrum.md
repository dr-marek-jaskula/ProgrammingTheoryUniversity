## Scrum

It is a framework for project management.

It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members, who break their work into **goals** that can be completed within time-boxed iterations, called **sprints**, no longer than one month and most commonly two weeks. 

The scrum team assess progress in time-boxed daily meetings of 15 minutes or less, called *daily scrums* (a form of stand-up meeting). 

At the end of the sprint, the team holds two further meetings: the sprint review which demonstrates the work done to stakeholders to elicit feedback, and sprint retrospective which enables the team to reflect and improve.
