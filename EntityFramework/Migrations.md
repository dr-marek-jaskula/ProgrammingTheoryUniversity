## Migrations

Migrations allow us to easily generate a C# code that represents the current state of our data models (with configurations) and then apply it to db.
In a *snapshot* we store the current form of the database, therefore only the required code is generated (that represents changes).
So migrations are generated by comparing the snapshot with the current the db state.

After we make a change in a data model we can make migrations by command:
> dotnet ef migrations add \<migrations name\>

We can undo the migrations using:
> dotnet ef migrations remove

Then we can apply migrations using:
> dotnet ef database update

To remove the migrations that was applied to the database we need to first:
+ Reverse change in a database by:
> dotnet ef database update \<name_of_previous_migrations\>
+ Remove the migration like in the previous way

We can add "-v" flag to get extra information about process (it refers to "verbose")

Entity Framework Core automatically stores the migrations history in a table called
"_EfMigrationsHistory".

Therefore, the same migrations will not be applied twice. 
We should not change this table.
